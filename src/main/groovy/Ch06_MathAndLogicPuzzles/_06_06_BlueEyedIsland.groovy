/** Q: All (>0) blue eyed people must leave from an island ASAP.
 *  Nobody knows their own eye color, just others'.
 *  How many days will it take them to leave? */

/** A: We will assume that 
 * 1) all blue eyed people will fit on a single flight
 * 2) all people are intelligent (or have worked out a plane beforehand).
 * Since everybody can assume, that if the plane didn't leave after as many days as the number of blue eyed people
 * the given person sees, she must have a blue eye also.
 * Therefore they will leave the day after that. */
